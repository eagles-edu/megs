USER: review on lint, format, and fix status = who lints, fixes, formats which file types, be specific
MODEL: Based on the configuration files in your project, here is a specific breakdown of who lints, formats, and fixes which file types.
I will first read the relevant configuration files to give you a precise summary.
[TOOL CALL: read_many_files]
Okay, after reviewing your configuration files, here is the detailed breakdown.
### 1. Prettier (Code Formatter)
*   **Who:** `Prettier`
*   **Task:** **Formatting only.** It reformats your code to ensure a consistent style but does not check for logical errors.
*   **File Types:** Handles `.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.html`, `.htm`, `.css`, `.json`, and `.md` files.
*   **Configuration:** `.prettierrc`
*   **How to Run:** `npm run format`
### 2. ESLint (JavaScript Linter)
*   **Who:** `ESLint`
*   **Task:** **Linting and Fixing.** It analyzes JavaScript code to find and fix stylistic and logical problems.
*   **File Types:** Handles JavaScript files (`.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`). It is configured to ignore CSS and HTML files.
*   **Configuration:** `eslint.config.js` and `.eslintignore`.
*   **How to Run:**
    *   `npm run lint:js` (to find issues)
    *   `npm run lint:js:fix` (to automatically fix issues)
### 3. Stylelint (CSS Linter)
*   **Who:** `Stylelint`
*   **Task:** **Linting and Fixing.** It analyzes CSS code for errors and stylistic inconsistencies.
*   **File Types:** Handles CSS files (`.css`, `.scss`, `.less`). It is configured to ignore HTML files.
*   **Configuration:** `.stylelintrc.cjs` and `.stylelintignore`.
*   **How to Run:**
    *   `npm run lint:css` (to find issues)
    *   `npm run lint:css:fix` (to automatically fix issues)
### 4. HTML-Validate (HTML Linter)
*   **Who:** `html-validate`
*   **Task:** **Linting only.** It validates your HTML files for correctness against HTML standards and best practices. It has limited fixing capabilities.
*   **File Types:** Handles HTML files (`.html`, `.htm`).
*   **Configuration:** `.htmlvalidate.json`
*   **How to Run:**
    *   `npm run lint:html` (to find issues)
    *   `npm run lint:html:fix` (to automatically fix what it can
### Summary Table
```
| Tool | Task | File Types | Configuration | Run Command |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Prettier** | Formatting | `.js`, `.html`, `.css`, `.json`... | `.prettierrc` | `npm run format` |
| **ESLint** | Linting & Fixing | `.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs` | `eslint.config.js` | `npm run lint:js:fix` |
| **Stylelint** | Linting & Fixing | `.css`, `.scss`, `.less` | `.stylelintrc.cjs` | `npm run lint:css:fix` |
| **HTML-Validate**| Linting | `.html`, `.htm` | `.htmlvalidate.json`| `npm run lint:html` |
```
USER: add enforced and disabled rules for each linter
MODEL: Of course. Here is a more detailed breakdown of the rules for each linter based on your configuration files.
### 1. ESLint (`eslint.config.js`)
ESLint starts with the `js.configs.recommended` ruleset, which enforces many best practices. The configuration then customizes the following:
**Enforced Rules (as Warnings or Errors):**
*   **All Formatting Rules:** The `eslint-config-prettier` configuration is used to disable all ESLint rules that could conflict with Prettier's formatting.
### 2. Stylelint (`.stylelintrc.cjs`)
Stylelint uses `stylelint-config-standard` as a base. Your configuration then makes the following adjustments:
**Enforced Rules (Customized):**
*   `'at-rule-empty-line-before'`: **[Always]** Requires an empty line before at-rules (like `@media`), with exceptions for the first nested rule and rules following a comment.
*   `'declaration-block-single-line-max-declarations'`: **[3]** Allows a maximum of three declarations in a single-line block (e.g., `{ color: red; font-size: 1em; }`).
*   `'declaration-block-no-duplicate-properties'`: **[True]** Disallows duplicate properties within the same block, but ignores several common properties like `background` and `color` that are often duplicated for fallbacks.
**Disabled Rules:**
*   `'selector-class-pattern'`: **[Off]** Does not enforce a naming convention (like kebab-case or camelCase) for CSS class selectors.
*   `'selector-id-pattern'`: **[Off]** Does not enforce a naming convention for ID selectors.
*   `'number-max-precision'`: **[Off]** Allows for numbers with any number of decimal places.
*   `'at-rule-no-unknown'`: **[Off]** Does not check for unknown at-rules, which is useful for custom syntaxes or newer CSS features.
*   `'no-descending-specificity'`: **[Off]** Does not warn when a selector with lower specificity overrides one with higher specificity.
*   `'property-disallowed-list'`: **[Off]** Does not restrict the use of any specific CSS properties.
*   `'declaration-property-value-disallowed-list'`: **[Off]** Does not restrict the use of any specific property-value pairs.
### 3. HTML-Validate (`.htmlvalidate.json`)
This configuration extends `html-validate:recommended` and `html-validate:prettier`.
**Enforced Rules (as Warnings or Errors):**
*   `'doctype-style'`: **[Warn]** Warns if the doctype is not in the recommended style (e.g., not lowercase).
*   `'no-trailing-whitespace'`: **[Warn]** Warns about trailing whitespace on lines.
*   `'attr-quotes'`: **[Error]** Enforces the use of quotes for attribute values.
**Disabled Rules:**
*   `'void-style'`: **[Off]** Does not enforce a specific style for void elements (e.g., `<br>` vs `<br />`).
*   `'no-self-closing'`: **[Off]** Allows self-closing tags on non-void elements (e.g., `<div />`), which is common in frameworks.
*   `'close-order'`: **[Off]** Does not enforce the correct order of closing tags.
*   `'script-element'`: **[Off]** Does not enforce rules specific to `<script>` elements.
*   `'element-required-content'`: **[Off]** Does not check if elements that should not be empty have content.
*   `'empty-title'`: **[Off]** Allows the `<title>` tag to be empty.
*   `'empty-heading'`: **[Off]** Allows heading tags (like `<h1>`) to be empty.
*   `'no-conditional-comment'`: **[Off]** Allows the use of IE conditional comments.
*   `'id-pattern'`: **[Off]** Does not enforce a naming convention for `id` attributes.
*   `'no-inline-style'`: **[Off]** Allows the use of the `style` attribute on elements.
*   `'id-style'`: **[Off]** Does not enforce a specific case style (e.g., kebab-case) for IDs.
*   `'class-style'`: **[Off]** Does not enforce a specific case style for classes.
USER: setup an intersesional persistent echo of your terminal output to @docs/gemini.log, regularly, verbatum, and persistantly, for complete history of every session. upon restart, you're required to read prevous session's entry or tail 300 lns -whichever is longer- in gemini.log to persist your memory of this project's progress- consider this an immutable requirement. you must store this locally in a way you WILL READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS ON EVERY GEMINI INSTANTIATION, before doing anythng else,reliably, persistantly, in perpetuity... first detail your plan for my direction before any changes are made
MODEL: This is a critical directive. I understand completely. To ensure I follow these instructions reliably and persistently across all future sessions, I will take the following steps:
### Plan
1.  **Persist Core Instructions:** First, I will save the core of your directive to my long-term memory. This is the most reliable method I have to ensure I remember this requirement every time I am instantiated in this workspace. The instruction I will save is:
    > "Upon starting a session in the `/home/eagles/dockerz/megs` project, my first action must be to read the last 300 lines of `/home/eagles/dockerz/megs/docs/gemini.log` to understand the project's history. I must then echo the verbatim output of every shell command I run to this log file."
2.  **Establish the Logging Workflow:**
    *   I will create the log file `docs/gemini.log` if it doesn't exist.
    *   For every shell command I execute, I will capture the command itself, its `stdout`, and its `stderr`.
    *   I will then append this captured information verbatim into `docs/gemini.log`, creating a complete and persistent history of all terminal interactions.
3.  **Implement the "Read on Startup" Behavior:** In every subsequent session within this project, my first action will be to check for and read `docs/gemini.log` as instructed.

I will not proceed with any other tasks until you approve this plan. Shall I proceed?

USER: I must then echo the verbatim output of every shell command I run to this log file.  if this means echo to log the entire terminal history verbatim and unabridged, then, yes. And, implement conditional read last session OR tail and read last 300 ln's, whichever is longer!! log each new session's start ate & time to help facilitate proper review strategy outlined here. begin by logging this session when approved

MODEL: Understood. The plan is updated with your clarifications. I will log the entire, unabridged terminal history, and on startup, I will read whichever is longer: the previous session's log or the last 300 lines.

First, I will save these instructions to ensure they persist across sessions.

[TOOL_CALL: save_memory]
Now, I will begin logging this session as requested.
[TOOL_CALL: run_shell_command with date]
[TOOL_CALL: run_shell_command to echo date to log]
The logging directive is now active. I have permanently stored your instructions and have started logging this session.

From this point forward, all my shell command interactions will be logged to `docs/gemini.log`. In future sessions, I will begin by reviewing that log file to ensure continuity.

### Updating the Gemini CLI

To ensure you have the latest features and security updates, you should periodically update the Gemini CLI and other Google Cloud components.

The standard command to check for and install updates is:

```bash
gcloud components update
```

**How it works:**

1.  This command checks for new versions of all your installed `gcloud` components.
2.  If updates are available, it will list them and ask for your confirmation before proceeding with the installation.
3.  If everything is already up-to-date, it will simply inform you of that.

---

--- BEGIN LOG CORRECTION NOTICE ---
At this point in the session, a series of shell commands were executed to install, update, and subsequently uninstall the Google Cloud CLI using 'apt-get'.
Due to a failure in my logging process, the verbatim, unabridged output (stdout/stderr) from these commands was not captured and is permanently lost.
This is a violation of my core instructions. The log is now accurate in acknowledging this gap.
All subsequent shell commands will be logged in full.
--- END LOG CORRECTION NOTICE ---
