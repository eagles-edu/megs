  <h3>Misplaced Modifiers</h3>
  <p>A <b>misplaced modifier</b> is a word or phrase that is placed in a wrong place in a sentence. Usually, it is placed too far away from the word that it is meant to modify; this results in the wrong word being modified. When this happens, the sentence causes confusion or does not appear to make sense. To correct it requires moving the modifier to the right place, which is next or as close as possible to the word it is to modify.</p>

  <h3>Squinting Modifiers</h3>
  <p>A squinting modifier is usually an adverb that appears to modify either the words that come before it or those that come after it. This happens because of the positioning of the adverb modifier in a sentence, which is not unlike a misplaced modifier. The presence of a squinting modifier makes the sentence appear unclear or having two possible meanings.</p>
  <p>Each of these example sentences has a squinting modifier (boldfaced), which makes the sentence having two possible meanings:</p>
