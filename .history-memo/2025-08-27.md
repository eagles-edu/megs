For rules that shouldn't be disabled globally, I will add /* stylelint-disable */
  comments to the top of the CSS files. This will provide targeted suppression of
  warnings.  yes, but only on things like duplicate tags with hex and rbg/a, per line not pages disables.  ,    `accordion.css` & `flyout.css`: I will add comments to disable warnings for !important -ok-
     and browser-specific class names (e.g., .msie6)  -no, delete any msie hacks, same goes for  vendor prefixes -- modernize -.
   * `meg-2.css`: This file already contains many stylelint-disable comments. I will clean
     up this section to keep only the necessary rules. -yes, but try to fix the lint error first and only disable the needed css that are good practices -
   * `template592f.css`: I will add comments to suppress warnings for vendor prefixes (e.g.,
     -webkit-) and IE hacks (e.g., *zoom: 1),  -no, eliminate them unles there still needed  since 2020 -  * settings json and  merge the two stylelint configuration files, ok and ok, respectively.   * For rules that shouldn't be disabled globally, I will add /* stylelint-disable */
  comments to the top of the CSS files - no, add them per line or section, unless modernization can fix them. this code is 19 years old, so updating is long overdue
