<h1>Proper Adjectives</h1>
<img src="../images/adjectives-proper.png" alt="proper adjectives"  style="width:460px;">
<blockquote><p>a <strong>Trumpian</strong> tweet, a <strong>Shakespearean</strong> play, the <strong>Thai</strong> baht, <strong>French</strong> cars</p></blockquote>
<p>Each of the four examples above contains an adjective (<em>Trumpian, Shakespearean, Thai, French</em>) and you will immediately note that each adjective is capitalized—it starts with a capital letter. That is because each of those adjectives comes from a name (<em>Trump, Shakespeare, Thailand, France</em>). Names of people, organizations, countries, towns etc are "<a href="https://www.englishclub.com/grammar/nouns-proper.htm">proper nouns</a>" and need to be capitalized in English. Adjectives made from proper nouns are "proper adjectives" and also need to be capitalized.</p>
<div><strong>Proper nouns</strong> are nouns that refer to unique places, people or organizations. The word "country" is a common noun because there are many countries. The word "Thailand" is a proper noun because there is only one Thailand and Thailand is its name. Just like you. You are unique and you have a name. Your name is a proper noun and in English we spell it with a capital letter at the start (example <strong><em>E</em></strong><em>lizabeth, <strong>D</strong>onald</em>).</div>
<h2>What are Proper Adjectives?</h2>
<p>Most adjectives are "<strong>common adjectives</strong>". They describe people, places and things, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>tall</em> man, <em>big</em> dog, <em>noisy</em> baby</li>
  <li><em>large</em> garden, <em>empty</em> room, <em>beautiful</em> city</li>
  <li><em>red</em> car, <em>hot</em> weather, <em>expensive</em> watch</li>
</ul>
<p>"<strong>Proper adjectives</strong>" also describe people, places and things, but they are based on <strong>names</strong> and therefore need to be capitalized, like the names. For example, Spain is the name of a country and starts with a capital letter. The adjective based on Spain (<strong><em>Spanish</em></strong>) must also start with a capital letter. Mars is the name of a planet and starts with a capital letter. The adjective based on Mars (<em><strong>Martian</strong></em>) must also start with a capital letter. Shakespeare was the name of a famous writer and starts with a capital letter. The adjective based on Shakespeare (<em><strong>Shakespearean</strong></em>) must also start with a capital letter.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Since you live in Spain, do you enjoy <em><strong>Spanish</strong></em> food?</li>
  <li>If people ever live on the planet Mars, they will have to endure the extremes of the <em><strong>Martian</strong></em> climate.</li>
  <li>Although William Shakespeare is best known for his plays, many exams also cover <em><strong>Shakespearean</strong></em> poetry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Proper adjectives are mostly of two types:</p>
<ol>
  <li>those that come from names of places—countries, continents, regions, cities</li>
  <li>those that come from names of people—usually famous people, mostly historical, some modern</li>
</ol>
<h2>Proper Adjectives from Place Names (countries, continents, regions, cities)</h2>
<p><strong>Your country</strong> is a proper noun and it has a capitalized <strong>proper adjective</strong>.

<h2>Proper Adjectives from People's Names (eponymous )</h2>
<p><strong>Your name</strong> is a proper noun and if you were super-famous it might have a capitalized proper adjective.

<h2>Prefixes with Proper Adjectives</h2>
<p>Normally, a prefix attached to a proper adjective should not be capitalized. Look at these examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>pre-Christian</em><br>
    Paganism was one of many pre-Christian religions.</li>
  <li><em>pan-European</em><br>
    The search for a pan-European identity started well before 1900.</li>
  <li><em>post-Thatcherite</em><br>
    Did wages go up in post-Thatcherite Britain?</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the prefix should not be capitalized, unless it starts the sentence:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>anti-Western</em><br>
    Anti-Western sentiment was an inevitable consequence.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the prefix itself is formed from a proper noun, then the prefix should of course by capitalized. In the following example, <em>Austro-</em> comes from the proper noun Austria and <em>Hungarian</em> comes from the proper noun Hungary.</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Austro-Hungarian</em><br>
    The assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne led directly to the First World War.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In the next example, the prefix <em>Afro-</em> comes from the proper noun Africa, and <em>Caribbean</em> is the proper adjective from the proper noun Caribbean:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Afro-Caribbean</em><br>
    He loves Afro-Caribbean music.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hyphenation with Proper Adjectives</h2>
<p>The same logic applies with suffixes and other hyphenated forms—capitalize only the word or words derived from a proper noun:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>English-speaking<br>
  </em>She asked for an English-speaking guide to show her around.</li>
</ul>
<h2>When Proper Adjectives Lose their Connection</h2>
<p>Sometimes proper adjectives lose their connection with the proper noun that gave them the right to be capitalized, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>gargantuan, titanic, caesarian, draconian, herculean, spartan</em></li>
</ul>
